    "I will using two boxplots in the same graph to visualize the comparsion between male and female, with x-axis of happiness rating and y-axis of category male and female. I am using boxplot because it is an easy tool to compare two boxplots with their median, Q1，Q3 and their outliers, which gives a more direct visualization of whether males or females is rating higher accroding to those distributions.\n",

    "first, we stimulate once: randomly take 30 males and 30 females sample, calculate both sample means and then get the difference of means, the difference is the threshold of being extreme\n",
    "second, taking 100 trails, each trail with 30 males and females, without replacement.\n",
    "using code to stimulation to calculate the sample mean of each time, then forming a distribution of sample means.\n",

    "Hypothesised possible results:\n",
    "I hypothesied that p-value< 0.05, we reject H0 and say there is likely a difference between male and female wellness life satisfaction.This relates to our first proposal question, helping to test that it is likely male or female has a different wellness life satisfaction value rate."
