    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",

    "1. conversations going beyond the intended scope of the material addressed by the question; and, \n",
    "2. unrecoverable confusion as a result of sequential layers logial inquiry that cannot be resolved. \n",

    "In the case of the former (1), adding constraints specifying the limits of considerations of interest tends to be helpful; whereas, the latter (2) is often the result of initial prompting that leads to poor developments in navigating the material, which are likely just best resolve by a \"hard reset\" with a new initial approach to prompting.

    "> A key issue to be aware of when asking ChatBots for help with something is that they are not running and checking code for correctess, and they often intertwine written instructions with code instructions; so, BEFORE YOU RUN ANY CODE provided by a ChatBot, you should check the following\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. If this code changes an object or data, are you sure you want to run this code?\n",
    "> 2. Can you easily \"undo\" the results of running code (e.g., from a copy `df_saved=df.copy()` or reloading the data) if running the code doesn't do what you want?\n",
    "> 3. Is the state of the data what is expected by the code? Or have the objects been updated and changed so they're no longer what the code expects them to be? \n",
    "> \n",
    "> #### If you get any `Python` errors, copy and paste them into the ChatBot prompt and see if it can help you resove them; but, keep in mind the final point above becasue the ChatBot might not be aware of the state of your objects relative to the code it's producing...\n",

    "> - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",

    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",

    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",

    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",

    "1. **GroupBy and Describe**:\n",
    "   - You asked about `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`. I explained that this groups the data by a column (`col1`) and provides descriptive statistics (like mean, standard deviation, etc.) for another column (`col2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Titanic Dataset**:\n",
    "   - You wanted to explore the Titanic dataset from a URL. I showed you how to check the columns using `df.columns` and view the first few rows using `df.head()`.\n",
    "   - I clarified that `col1` and `col2` in the context of the groupby operation refer to column names (e.g., `pclass` and `age`), not row indices or sets of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - You asked about the standard deviation (SD) between two values. We calculated:\n",
    "     - Between 1 and 0: SD = 0.5\n",
    "     - Between 1 and 1: SD = 0 (since no variation).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Percentiles**:\n",
    "   - We calculated the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles (quartiles) for different data sets:\n",
    "     - For values 0 and 1: 25% = 0.25, 50% = 0.50, 75% = 0.75.\n",

    "1. **Pandas Errors**: You encountered several errors while working with `pandas`:\n",
    "   - **`NameError: name 'pd' is not defined`**: This happened because `pandas` was not imported. The fix was adding `import pandas as pd`.\n",
    "   - **`FileNotFoundError`**: This occurred because the file `'titanics.csv'` could not be found. The solution was either checking the file path or using an online CSV file.\n",
    "   - **`NameError: name 'DF' is not defined`**: You used `DF` instead of `df`, and the fix was to use the correct variable name `df`.\n",
    "   - **`SyntaxError: '(' was never closed`**: This was fixed by adding the missing closing parenthesis in the `pd.read_csv()` call.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **KeyError and Case Sensitivity**:\n",
    "   - You encountered `KeyError: 'wealth'`, which was resolved by checking the available columns using `print(df.columns)` and using an existing column like `\"class\"` or `\"sex\"`.\n",
    "   - You also faced a `NameError` for using `sex` without quotes, which was resolved by passing `\"sex\"` as a string.\n",
